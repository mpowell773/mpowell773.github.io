# Project Overview

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|Day 1| Project Description | Completed
|Day 1| Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeline | Completed
|Day 3| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|Day 4| MVP & Bug Fixes | Incomplete
|Day 5| Final Touches | Incomplete
|Day 6| Present | Incomplete


## Project Description

This project is specifically for creating a portfolio website that I can utilize to display future projects in class and later on professionally. I have noticed that I tend to like more minimalistic designs with some flavor of interactivity. Good examples of these designs include [Corey Hughart](https://coryhughart.com/) and [Gift Egwuenu](https://www.giftegwuenu.dev/).

## Wireframes

My wireframes are definitely focused on Mobile, with the key features being listed there. The Desktop (and Tablet sans 1 column) are more for layout purposes.

## Time/Priority Matrix 

- [List](documentation-photos/prio-matrix-list.jpg)
- [Graph](documentation-photos/prio-matrix-graph.jpg)

My total list adds up to 17.5 hours, which I'm pretty sure is a low ball. I'm guessing that this is around 27-8 hours if I attempt all the details.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Build the layout of the site
- Style appropriately and note responsiveness
- Nav bar functionality
- Project links
- Basic animation of sections and nav bar items

#### PostMVP 

- Project about sections
- Contact section backend
- Skills icons
- Skills carousel

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into smaller components.  Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the portfolio. Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the portfolio must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

| Responsive | H | 3hr | hr | hr |
| Section Bar Animation| M | 2hr | hr|
| Nav Bar Underline Animation| M| 2hrs|  hr | 
| Total | H | 15.5hrs| hrs |

#### PostMVP
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: |

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description  

```
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```

## Issues and Resolutions
